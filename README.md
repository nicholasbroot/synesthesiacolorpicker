- If you want to run your own custom colorpicker experiment (or use the pre-made template) using Qualtrics, you can read instructions on how to do so by clicking the "qualtrics" folder above. If you do not have any previous programming experience, this is the easiest version of the colorpicker to work with. However, you will need a Qualtrics license to use this (e.g., many psychology departments at universities have institutional subscriptions).
- If you want to run your own custom colorpicker experiment (or use the pre-made template) using LabJS/Open Lab, you can read instructions on how to do so by clicking the "labjs" folder above. Unlike Qualtrics, LabJS experiments can be run for free. However, the interface is slightly less intuitive, and adding features to the experiment (i.e., beyond the basic test-retest consistency experiment I provide here) may require some basic knowledge of HTML.
- If you want to create your own custom experiment using only the Javscript colorpicker code (i.e., without using Qualtrics or LabJS), you can download the Javascript files  above. Unlike the Qualtrics and LabJS templates, modifying and using these files requires significant knowledge of Javascript and HTML.
